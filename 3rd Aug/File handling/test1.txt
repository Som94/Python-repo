Since 1999, millions of people have expressed themselves word1 on Blogger. 
From detailed posts about word2 almost every apple variety you could ever 
imagine word3 to a blog word4 dedicated to the art word5 of blogging itself, 
the ability to easily share, publish and express oneself on the web 
is at the core of Blogger’s mission. As the web constantly evolves, 
we want to ensure anyone using Blogger has an easy and intuitive 
experience publishing their content to the web.  
That’s why we’ve been slowly introducing an improved web experience 
for Blogger. Give the fresh interface a spin by clicking “Try the New Blogger” 
in the left-hand navigation pane.
